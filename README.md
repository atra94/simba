# SimBa
SimBa is a NumBa based Simulation framework for interconnected dynamical systems.

SimBa is work in progress at a very early stage. A first version that is still based on pure python is planned to be released until March 2021. 

This framework aims to provide you the basic tools such that you can define your own dynamic system models that are composed of multiple components. The target is to offer the whole flexibility of Python during the definition of the system and the full speed of numba during simulation time. 

A first working example of how SimBa works and what you can expect is available in the examples folder.
